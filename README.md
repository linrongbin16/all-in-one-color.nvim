# colorswitch.nvim

A colorscheme switch and collection plugin for Neovim.

## Introduction

Want more colorschemes for your Neovim? This is it.

This plugin contains the vim command `SwitchColor` to switch colorscheme for you.
The difference from vim builtin command `colorscheme` is that you could
configure how and when to switch your color:

- Choose policy:

  - Random
  - Ordered

- Time policy:

  - Startup
  - Fixed time interval
  - Fixed time point

While the real power comes with a webpage crawler that collects **awesome**
colorschemes from:

- [vimcolorscheme.com/top](https://vimcolorschemes.com/top).
- [awesome-neovim#colorscheme](https://www.trackawesomelist.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim/readme/#colorscheme).

Use the collections as SwitchColor's candidates. The term '**awesome**' is
defined by:

1. Github stars &ge; 400.
2. Last commit in 2 years(365 days/year).
3. For multiple ports/variants, keep the one with more plugins support, stars or
   git commits.
